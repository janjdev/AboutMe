# About Me
For this project; students will be tasked with creating an Xcode project and app that displays a profile page with some basic information about that student.  
See `CreatingAnXcodeProject.pdf` for instructions on how to create the project file for this assignment.
See `AboutMe_Screenshot.pdf` for an example of what the profile page should look like.  

### Objectives
* Create a brand new Xcode project
* Utilize *UI components* such as `UILabel` and `UIImageView`

### Tasks
This project will require students to do several things:

* Create a brand new __Xcode project__
* Build the necessary user interface elements in `Main.storyboard`
* __Connect__ those interface elements to `ViewController.swift` as `IBOutlet`s if appropriate

### Requirements
* A `UIImageView` located somewhere on screen __must__ display a profile picture
* `UILabel`s __must__ be implemented to display the following information:
    * The student's __name__
    * The student's __major__
    * The student's __ssoid__
    * Some text providing a brief description (minimum of __1__ paragraph) either about the student, or why they chose the major that they are studying.

### Extra Credit
Up to __5__ points of extra credit is available for getting creative with the project and adding additional features or capabilities. Ensure the project meets __ALL__ of the base requirements __before__ attempting to add anything extra! Students should include a `EXTRACREDIT.md` file with their project submission that details any additional features added in order to be considered for the extra credit points.

### Notes
* __No Autolayout__: Just design for the __iPhone 11 Pro Max__ in portrait mode and use the __iPhone 11 Pro Max Simulator__ when testing

### Submission
* Projects should run on a minimum of __Xcode 11.3__
* Projects should be free of compile-time errors and crashes (run-time errors)
* Projects should not have any compile-time warnings (in yellow)
* Any of the files included in the repository containing this assignments instructions __MUST__ be deleted from the project directory before submission
* If work for this assignment was completed within a __github repository__, the following files/directories __MUST__ be deleted from the project directory before submission:
    * `README.md`
    * `.gitignore`
    * `.git/`
    * `.github/`

When ready to submit; the student should rename the directory containing their project to their __UMSL ssoid__ (e.g. 'gmhz7b').  
Then, *right-click* on that folder and select the option that should say ' __Compress "{ssoid_directory_name}"__ '. Finally, upload the resulting __zip__ file to __Canvas__.  
Students should take special care to ensure their projects are devoid of compile-time errors/warnings and run-time errors. Failure to do so will result in significant deductions.
